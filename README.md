# Toilet Guide
## Concepts
The concept of this app comes from my daily experience: I am not used to use those public toilets which crowded, smells bad, etc. So, I thought there should be an online map service which can provide some statistics data or simply reviews to a toilet. But actually, most of the toilets on the major map platform has no review. The application here come for solve this problem.
